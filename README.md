# Candid-Photography-Platform

This website is a photography platform designed to help users find the perfect photographer for their photo sessions. The homepage serves as the starting point, where users can easily navigate to various sections, including an information page that provides details about the platform along with testimonials from satisfied users.

The site offers the ability to create an account. Once registered or logged in, users can browse a collection of photographers, each having their own dedicated page. These pages feature descriptions, areas of expertise, and portfolios showcasing their best work.

Additionally, users can search for photographers by name or browse through a list of available photographers. If a photographer catches their interest, users can add them to their "Favorites." This list of favorite photographers is displayed on the "Account" page, making it easy to access and manage personal preferences.

The platform was built using HTML, CSS, and PHP for the backend. It runs on a local server set up with XAMPP, using phpMyAdmin for database management. The design of the website was created using Figma, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
